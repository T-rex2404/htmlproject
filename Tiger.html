    <h1> The Tiger </h1>

    <h3>

        Panthera tigris, or the tiger, is a large Asian animal that is the largest of natural cats. While often thought
        to be similar with the
        lion, tigers and lions actually have many differences. Tigers aren't sociable, but lions are, and lions don't
        swim, but tigers enjoy
        doing so. Despite this, lions and tigers can make hybrids, like the tigon, and the largest extant cat, the
        liger. Tigers have many
        subspecies. The largest tigers are the Siberian tigers, while other subspecies include the Bengal tiger, South
        China tiger,
        Malay tiger, Indochinese tiger, and Sumatran tiger. Extinct subspecies include the Caspian tiger, the Javan
        tiger, and the Bali tiger.
        Tigers are famous creatures. They have distinctive black stripes with orange between them and white in some
        areas. In some tigers, all
        the orange is replaced with white. They are very recognizable apex predators, with powerful forelimbs, a large
        head, a tail half the
        length of its body, and have night vision 6 times better than humans, despite not being strongly adapted to the
        dark.
