    <h3>

        Bears are among the most well-known animals. There are 7 species, which in turn, have many subspecies and there
        are also extinct species like the Florida spectacled bear. The 7 species are the mostly-carnivorous polar bear
        from the Arctic, the only South American bear, the spectacled bear, the insectivorous and fruit-eating sloth
        bear from Asia, the Southeast Asian and partly-arboreal sun bear, the Asian black bear, the ominvorous North
        American black bear, the North American and Eurasian brown bear, and the herbivorous giant panda from China.
        The bears are very different, but all of them are biologically related and are all four-legged.
